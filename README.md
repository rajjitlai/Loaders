# Neon SVG Text Loader

A vibrant, lightweight, and animated SVG text loader.

## Features
-   **Vibrant Neon Colors**: Uses a cycle of Magenta, Neon Green, Cyan, Bright Red, and Yellow.
-   **Smooth Animation**: Elegant stroke-dashoffset animation for a "writing" effect.
-   **Single File**: All code (HTML, CSS, JS) is contained in `index.html` for easy portability.
-   **Copy & Paste Ready**: The interface provides buttons to instantly copy the necessary HTML and CSS for use in your own projects.

## Usage
Simply open `index.html` in your web browser.

1.  View the "Load" animation in the main viewport.
2.  Click **Copy HTML** to get the structure.
3.  Click **Copy CSS** to get the styles.

## Customization
To change the text, simply edit the content inside the `<text>` tag in the SVG within `index.html`. To change colors, modify the `.copy1` through `.copy5` classes in the CSS.
